# Workflows

Reusable workflows for use.

## Intro

GitHub [introduced reusable workflows](https://github.blog/2021-11-29-github-actions-reusable-workflows-is-generally-available/) on 2021-11-29 which, as the name suggests, are workflows that can be referenced across the entirety of GitHub.

For more information, including limitations, [see the GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows).

## Usage

A reusable workflow is called by using the `uses` keyword in another workflow:

```yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'
      - '*.md'
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'
      - '*.md'

jobs:
  call-reuseable-workflow:
    uses: dancastillo/workflows/.github/workflows/github-actions.yml
```
